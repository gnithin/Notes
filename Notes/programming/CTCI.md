# Cracking the interview code Notes

- Practicing 
	- Do it on your own
	- Write code on paper
		- This will slow down everything. I agree
	- Debug and test on paper
	- Type into console

- Solving a problem
	- Write out all the cases that the problem must solve
	- Try to brute force it
	- Always try to take a big example after brute-forcing it
		- Example - Given 2 strings, a and b, find occurences of permutations of a, in b.
		- Doing it after the brute force way, manually, with an example is super helpful
	- For extra "points;' show excitement about solving hard problems
